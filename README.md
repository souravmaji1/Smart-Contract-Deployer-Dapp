Introduction:
SmartContractX is made for deploying smart contract by pasting source code and private key and within 10-20 seconds it will provide you the contract address
also I have added functionality to choose multiple blockchain network to select and deploy your smart contract just haven't connected that in the frontend also
I have integrated OpneAI which will help developers to generate smart contract 

Technologies Used:
Nextjs
Etherjs
OpenAi
